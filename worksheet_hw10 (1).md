## Privacy Policy Justification Worksheet

1. Briefly describe the website you built fo the project (its
   purpose/functionality/etc.)

 The website I built with my team is called BlazeNEU. its serves as a virtual public forum where students can post entries about companies, and receive information as to whether or not a given company drug tests. We developed this app as often on social media and on r/NEU (the northeastern reddit page), students will often ask if a given company they're applying to coop at drug tests their employees. Our website exists to provide transparency to solve this issue, and a safe place to ask about this information anonymously. Our team's belief is that this transparency will be mutually beneficial for both students and employees. 


2. Identify the stakeholders (direct and indirect) whose interests are relevant
   to your website.

direct: 
- Students seeking information about drug testing regarding a given company.
- Students providing information about drug testing regarding a given company.

indirect: 
- Companies listed on our website incluiding its employees/recuriters who's drug testing information is being disclosed.
- The BlazeNEU staff (we have incentive to make money, and are affected by the website itself)
- Companies that may want to buy student information

3. What data will you have access to, and what might this data reveal about its
   subjects?

we will have access to the following:

- Usernames for any user that signs up on our site.
- Emails assosciated to said usernames.

- Companies posted by users (a company's name, and location) 
- Any entries made by a given user on a company.
- Information from entries (Co-op cycle for when a student worked at the company, drug testing information, and additional notes).


what does this reveal?

- by signing up and viewing entries (but not posting anything), you reveal that you probably are concerned about a company's drug testing policy (and consequently that you probably use drugs or other substances).
- by creating a company who's drug testing you're inquiring about you're revealing that you are concerned about that company's drug testing policy (and consequently that you probably use drugs or other substances).
- by creating an entry you're likely revealing that you have worked at a given company, and either:
      -  A, have previously been concerned about the given company's drug testing policy (and consequently that you likely use drugs or other substances).
      -  or B, are looking to pass on information regarding a given company's drug testing policy for the sake of other students.
- by viewing a company, where you are (roughly) physically located, and that you have interest in working at said company assuming this viewing is not accidental.

4. What values are relevant to your website and its privacy policy? (Note that
   the relevant values will depend in part on the kind of website you are
   building).

- transparency.
- student success
- student privacy
- student autonomy

5. What counts as “success” for the website you are building?

 a site in which students can find accurate information regarding drug testing at companies they want to work at, while knowing that their seeking or discussion of company information can't cause them any harm


6. Describe how you took the relevant values into account in writing your
   privacy policy (e.g. what decisions and tradeoffs were made, and why).
   
    There was a delicate balance between student privacy, and monetary gain made by the BlazeNEU team. the BlazeNEU team would likely gain money from selling student data, or by creating target advertising based on the viewing of companies. 
    to maximize both I've declared that while we do retain the right to create targeted advertising based on viewing companies, however, this is only true for users who are logged in. if a user still wants to view entries and not post anything you can do so anonymously if you choose to do so without fear of data collection.  
   Furthermore, while we do intend to collect entry data (potentially to sell), this data will not be assosciated to the users who posted it in order for their entry data to remain anonymous.
